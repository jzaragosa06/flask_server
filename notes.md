Changes:
in the results of forecast, seasonality, and trend
operation, we will be using the original column name in describing the column name of the results Dataframe.
Effect:
In the web application, we shall update the way we access the json data. that is we shall use more bracket operator than the dot operator.



Reminder:
1. in order for the modules to work/get imported properly, we started the import from the app, since it contains **init**.py file, this will be treated as a module.
