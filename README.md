# Flask server for my automated time series forecasting project

This server has the following functionality: 
1) Forecast on univariate or multivariate time series data. Either the data has a same frequency (day, week, month, quarter, year) or has a recurring gap/skip. 
2) Analyze the trend of time series data using simple-moving average with n-moving window. 
3) Analyze for the seasonality of time series data.
